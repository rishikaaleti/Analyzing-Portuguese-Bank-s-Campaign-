# Analyzing- Portuguese Bank's Campaign
This project analyzes Portuguese bank campaign data to predict customer commitment to term deposits. Using data analytics, R, Python, and SQL, the study identifies key factors influencing subscription, highlighting high-risk factors, especially for married individuals with balance correlation. Recommendations stress informing banks about these factors for better customer record management. The project employs statistical analysis and visualization tools to answer research questions and demonstrate dataset understanding.

## Introduction
The selected dataset is of a Portuguese banking institution’s direct marketing campaign via phone calls. 
The main objective is to predict whether the customers will sign up for a term deposit. The data is related 
with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. This dataset is obtained from uci.edu 
which is a machine learning repository made open for public usage. The dataset characteristics are 
multivariate, and the attribute characteristics are real. The primary associated task is to classify the 
dataset consisting of 45211 number of instances and 17 attributes. This dataset was collected in the year 
2012. My interest in the domain is to analyze these variety of 17 attributes that are listed in the dataset. 
As this is a banking domain category related dataset it will have all the NOIR datatypes to perform 
qualitative and quantitative analysis required for the project.
In the profundity of analyzing the selected dataset led to these research questions. The research 
questions are as follows: -
#### 1. Are the campaigns sufficient to attract all different types of customers? 
#### 2. Does marital status of an individual customer cause any change in the balance of the account? 
#### 3. Is the account’s balance directly proportional to the marital status and subscription of the term deposit?
The potential benefits of answering research questions are numerous. The importance of studying the 
dataset is to provide information about the analysis of the customers, balance based on marital status 
and in-depth insights about the campaigns that were conducted to attract different types of customers. 
By knowing whether the campaigns were sufficient or were they not sufficient to achieve the goal we can 
get insights and help the bank in deciding on the campaign patterns. The final decision of how the 
campaigns should be carried out in future can be made by the analysis of the present campaigns. The 
marital status of an individual customer may cause changes in the account’s main balance. Performing 
analysis on marital status provides us with information that divorced people are broke, which results in a 
low balance, and could be one of the reasons those customers do not choose to subscribe to the term 
deposit. Performing analysis on balance of the main account provides insights into the term deposits 
subscriptions. It gives us significant information related to the annual number of subscriptions taken in 
the bank and helps in decision making in the subscription plan by the bank. Any changes that need to be 
made in the plan will be made and implemented in the coming years to attract more customers.
